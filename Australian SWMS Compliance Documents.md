## **Part 1: The National Framework for Safe Work Method Statements**

### **1.1 The Role of Safe Work Australia and the Model WHS Laws**

The foundation of work health and safety (WHS) regulation in Australia is a harmonised system, spearheaded by the national policy body, Safe Work Australia (SWA). Established to lead the development of national policy and strategies to improve WHS and workers' compensation arrangements, SWA's primary contribution to the regulatory landscape was the creation of the model Work Health and Safety (WHS) laws in 2011\.1 These model laws, comprising a model Act, model Regulations, and model Codes of Practice, serve as a blueprint for the Commonwealth, states, and territories to enact their own corresponding legislation.

It is a critical legal and operational distinction that Safe Work Australia is a policy body, not a regulator.3 It does not administer or enforce WHS laws, conduct workplace inspections, or impose penalties. That function is exclusively reserved for the statutory WHS regulator in each jurisdiction.3 Consequently, while the model laws have led to a high degree of legislative alignment—or harmonisation—across the country, they do not constitute a single, uniform national law. Each state and territory (with the exception of Victoria, which operates under a separate legislative framework) has adopted the model laws into its own statutes, and each jurisdiction's regulator is responsible for their administration and enforcement.

This creates a "harmonised but not identical" paradigm. For a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU), particularly a principal contractor operating across multiple states, this is the central challenge of national compliance. While the core principles and duties are largely consistent, subtle but significant variations exist in the enacted legislation, the approved Codes of Practice, and the specific interpretations and enforcement priorities of each regulator. A PCBU cannot assume that a compliance strategy perfected in one jurisdiction will be sufficient in another. Legal compliance is determined not by adherence to the SWA model, but by adherence to the specific Act, Regulation, and approved Codes of Practice as enacted and enforced in the jurisdiction where the work is being performed. Therefore, national compliance necessitates a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction approach, built upon the foundational principles of the model laws but tailored to the specific requirements of each state and territory regulator.

### **1.2 Defining a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS): Purpose and Legal Standing**

Within the model WHS framework, a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) is a specific and mandatory legal document required for a defined set of high-risk activities. A SWMS is a written document that systematically sets out the high-risk construction work (HRCW) activities to be carried out at a workplace, identifies the hazards arising from these activities, and describes the measures to be put in place to control the associated risks.3

The primary purpose of a SWMS is to serve as a practical risk management tool that helps supervisors and workers confirm and monitor the control measures required to perform HRCW safely.6 It is not intended to be an exhaustive procedural document. A SWMS is legally classified as an administrative control, which is a lower-order control in the hierarchy of risk management. Its function is to support higher-order controls, such as engineering controls (e.g., installing guardrails) or substitution (e.g., using a safer substance).6 It is distinct from other safety documents like a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) or a Safe Operating Procedure (SOP), which typically provide a more detailed, step-by-step guide to performing a specific task. A SWMS is focused specifically on the nexus between the HRCW activity, its inherent hazards, and the high-level controls to manage them.

A common compliance pitfall is to create an overly complex or lengthy SWMS, which can render it difficult for workers to understand and apply at the workplace.6 The model WHS Regulations and associated guidance stress that a SWMS should be short, concise, and focused on communicating the critical risk controls effectively, including through the use of pictures or diagrams for workers from non-English speaking backgrounds.8

### **1.3 High-Risk Construction Work (HRCW): The 18 Triggers for a Mandatory SWMS**

The legal requirement to prepare a SWMS is not subjective; it is explicitly triggered when a work activity falls into one of the 18 categories of "high-risk construction work" (HRCW) defined in the model WHS Regulations.6 A SWMS is not required for work of a minor nature that does not involve these activities.8 This creates a clear distinction between a general perception of risk and a specific legal obligation. While a PCBU has a primary duty of care to manage all workplace risks so far as is reasonably practicable, the duty to prepare a SWMS is confined to these 18 prescribed activities.

This distinction has significant implications for compliance management. Supervisors and managers must be trained to identify these specific HRCW triggers, as their presence on a work site automatically activates the legal machinery of SWMS preparation, consultation, implementation, and review. Relying on a subjective assessment of whether a task is "dangerous" is insufficient and legally non-compliant. Conversely, focusing exclusively on the 18 HRCW activities while neglecting other serious, non-prescribed hazards would constitute a failure of the PCBU's broader primary duty of care. The SWMS is a legally mandated minimum for specific tasks, not a replacement for a comprehensive site-wide safety management system.

The 18 HRCW activities defined under the model WHS Regulations are as follows 6:

1. Work that involves a risk of a person falling more than 2 metres (or 3 metres in some jurisdictions, a key variation to be noted).  
2. Work on a telecommunication tower.  
3. Demolition of an element of a structure that is load-bearing or otherwise related to the physical integrity of the structure.  
4. Work that involves, or is likely to involve, the disturbance of asbestos.  
5. Structural alterations or repairs that require temporary support to prevent collapse.  
6. Work in or near a confined space.  
7. Work in or near a shaft or trench with an excavated depth greater than 1.5 metres, or a tunnel.  
8. The use of explosives.  
9. Work on or near pressurised gas distribution mains or piping.  
10. Work on or near chemical, fuel, or refrigerant lines.  
11. Work on or near energised electrical installations or services.  
12. Work in an area that may have a contaminated or flammable atmosphere.  
13. Work involving tilt-up or precast concrete.  
14. Work on, in, or adjacent to a road, railway, shipping lane, or other traffic corridor that is in use by traffic other than pedestrians.  
15. Work in an area at a workplace in which there is movement of powered mobile plant.  
16. Work in an area in which there are artificial extremes of temperature.  
17. Work in or near water or other liquid that involves a risk of drowning.  
18. Diving work.

## **Part 2: Federal Resources and Guidance**

### **2.1 Safe Work Australia: Model Code of Practice for Construction Work**

Safe Work Australia provides the foundational guidance document for the construction industry, the *Model Code of Practice: Construction Work*.14 This document is an approved code of practice under section 274 of the model WHS Act and serves as the primary practical guide for achieving the standards of health and safety required by the model WHS laws.15

The model Code is not legally binding in itself. However, it becomes legally relevant once it is approved by the Minister in a specific jurisdiction. In legal proceedings, an approved code of practice is admissible as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk, or control, and can be used by a court to determine what is "reasonably practicable" in the circumstances.15 A PCBU who complies with an approved Code of Practice is generally considered to have complied with their health and safety duties in relation to the subject matter of the code.15

The *Model Code of Practice: Construction Work* provides comprehensive guidance on all aspects of construction safety, with dedicated sections on the preparation, content, and implementation of SWMS for HRCW.18 It includes templates and detailed explanations of the duties of various parties, including principal contractors, designers, and workers.18 This model code is the source document from which most states and territories have developed their own approved codes, making it an essential reference for understanding the baseline requirements across Australia. It is available for download from the Safe Work Australia website in both PDF and DOCX formats.14

### **2.2 Safe Work Australia: Interactive SWMS Tool and Guidance Materials**

To supplement the formal Code of Practice, Safe Work Australia has developed practical tools aimed at improving understanding and application of SWMS requirements, particularly for small businesses and those new to the industry.3

The flagship resource is the **Interactive SWMS Tool**.3 This online tool provides step-by-step guidance on how to prepare, use, and review a SWMS in the workplace. It incorporates videos and activities to explain the purpose of a SWMS and how it contributes to workplace safety.7 The tool is structured into modules covering the SWMS overview, preparation, and use, and includes a toolkit with examples of the 18 HRCW activities.7 It is an invaluable resource for training and for PCBUs who need to develop their own SWMS without extensive in-house expertise.

In addition, SWA publishes a concise **Information Sheet on Safe Work Method Statements for High Risk Construction Work**. This document provides a clear summary of the key requirements for SWMS under the model WHS laws.6 It explains what a SWMS is, when it is required, what information it must contain, and the duties of PCBUs in relation to its preparation and implementation. This information sheet is available as a downloadable PDF and DOCX file, making it a convenient reference document for site managers and compliance officers.19

### **2.3 Commonwealth Jurisdiction (Comcare)**

The Commonwealth WHS jurisdiction applies to Australian Government employees (such as the public service and the Australian Defence Force) and employees of private corporations that are licensed to self-insure under the Comcare scheme.1 The regulator for this jurisdiction is

**Comcare**.1

The Commonwealth operates under its own enactment of the model laws: the *Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth)* and the *Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011 (Cth)*.1 As such, the requirements for SWMS for HRCW within the Comcare jurisdiction align with the national model framework. Any PCBU undertaking construction work for an Australian Government agency or as part of the Comcare scheme must comply with the Commonwealth WHS Act and any specific guidance or regulatory priorities issued by Comcare.21 Comcare's role includes conducting inspections and enforcing compliance within its jurisdiction to maintain safe and healthy workplaces.21

## **Part 3: State and Territory Compliance Dossier**

This section provides a detailed, jurisdiction-specific breakdown of the regulatory framework, guidance materials, and operational documents for SWMS compliance across Australia.

### **3.1 New South Wales (NSW)**

* **Regulatory Authority:** **SafeWork NSW**. As of July 2025, SafeWork NSW is established as an independent, standalone regulator with a dedicated SafeWork Commissioner and Advisory Council, enhancing its governance and strategic direction.22 It is responsible for administering and enforcing WHS laws, offering advice, investigating incidents, and promoting a safer working environment in NSW.20  
* **Governing Legislation:**  
  * *Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW)* 23  
  * *Work Health and Safety Regulation 2017 (NSW)* 23  
* **Approved Code of Practice:** The primary guidance document is the **Code of Practice – Construction work**. This code provides practical guidance on how to meet the requirements of the NSW WHS Act and Regulation, including detailed information on the preparation and implementation of SWMS.27 NSW has also approved a suite of other construction-related codes, such as those for demolition, excavation, and managing the risk of falls, which should be read in conjunction with the main construction code.27  
* **SWMS Templates and Guidance:** SafeWork NSW provides official, ready-to-use SWMS templates as part of its "Housing industry site safety pack".29 These are available in two formats:  
  * **PDF:** Template 5: Safe work method statement (SWMS) 29  
  * **MS Word (DOCX):** Template 5: Safe work method statement (SWMS) 29

### **3.2 Victoria (VIC)**

Victoria stands apart from the harmonised WHS model, operating under its own distinct legislative framework. This is a critical point for any national operator, as compliance processes must be specifically adapted for Victorian worksites.

* **Regulatory Authority:** **WorkSafe Victoria**. It serves as both the state's workplace health and safety regulator and its workplace injury insurer, with a dual focus on preventing workplace harm and improving outcomes for injured workers.30  
* **Governing Legislation:**  
  * *Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic)* 1  
  * *Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017 (Vic)* 1  
* **Compliance Codes and Guidance:** Instead of adopting the model Codes of Practice, Victoria uses its own system of **Compliance Codes**.1 While there isn't a single, overarching "Construction Work" compliance code, guidance on SWMS is provided directly by WorkSafe Victoria through its website and publications.34 The definition of "high risk construction work" that triggers a SWMS in Victoria differs from the 18 categories in the model WHS laws. For example, the Victorian regulations specify HRCW includes work where there is a risk of a person falling more than 2 metres, work on or next to roadways, work near water with a risk of drowning, and work in trenches deeper than 1.5 metres, among others.34 This list is more concise than the model list and must be consulted directly to ensure compliance.  
* **SWMS Templates and Guidance:** WorkSafe Victoria provides a downloadable **SWMS template** on its website.34 The guidance provided emphasizes that the SWMS should not include risk matrices or references to external standards, as these are not legally required in Victoria and can complicate the document.34

### **3.3 Queensland (QLD)**

* **Regulatory Authority:** **Workplace Health and Safety Queensland (WHSQ)**. WHSQ is the state's WHS regulator and is a division of the Office of Industrial Relations (OIR).4 Its role includes enforcing WHS laws, investigating serious incidents, and educating employers and employees on their legal obligations.4  
* **Governing Legislation:**  
  * *Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Qld)* 36  
  * *Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (Qld)* 36  
* **Approved Code of Practice:** Queensland has a range of approved codes of practice relevant to the construction industry, based on the national models. These include specific codes for *Formwork*, *Demolition Work*, *Excavation Work*, and *Managing the risk of falls at workplaces*.13 The overarching principles are also outlined in the  
  *Queensland Code of Practice for the Building and Construction Industry*.41 PCBUs must consult the relevant code for the specific HRCW being undertaken.  
* **SWMS Templates and Guidance:** While WorkSafe Queensland's primary SWMS page was inaccessible during research 43, other official and industry-provided templates are available. The Queensland Department of Education provides a comprehensive  
  **SWMS template (DOCX)** specifically for working at heights, which can be adapted for other tasks.44 Other detailed templates are also available from industry sources, providing practical examples of how to structure a SWMS for HRCW in Queensland.45 Safe Work Australia also provides a generic information sheet and template that are applicable under Queensland's harmonised laws.8

## **Part 4: Synthesis of Core Compliance Obligations**

Across the harmonised jurisdictions, a consistent set of core legal obligations governs the lifecycle of a SWMS. These duties relate to its preparation, content, implementation, and retention.

### **4.1 Preparation and Consultation**

The duty to ensure a SWMS is prepared before HRCW commences rests with the PCBU whose workers will be performing the task.8 This preparation is not a unilateral administrative task; it is a consultative process. The model WHS laws and all corresponding state and territory acts place a mandatory duty on the PCBU to consult with the workers who will be directly engaged in the HRCW, as well as their Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs), if any.28 This consultation must be genuine and should occur during the preparation of the SWMS and again whenever it is reviewed.78 The purpose is to ensure that the knowledge and experience of front-line workers are incorporated into the risk control process, leading to a more practical and effective SWMS.

### **4.2 Content and Site-Specific Adaptation**

A SWMS must, at a minimum, identify the HRCW, the associated hazards and risks, the control measures to be used, and how those measures will be implemented, monitored, and reviewed.7 While a PCBU may start with a generic template, it is legally insufficient to use it without modification. The SWMS must be adapted to be "site-specific".6 This means it must be reviewed and revised to account for the unique conditions of the particular workplace, including the physical environment, the specific plant and equipment being used, the interface with other work activities, and the workers carrying out the task.10 Failure to make a generic SWMS site-specific is a common point of non-compliance.

### **4.3 Implementation, Monitoring, and Review**

A SWMS is not a "set and forget" document. The PCBU has an ongoing duty to ensure that the HRCW is performed in accordance with the SWMS.10 This requires active monitoring and supervision. A critical and universal compliance requirement is that if work is not being conducted in accordance with the SWMS, it must stop immediately or as soon as it is safe to do so.6 Work cannot resume until the SWMS is complied with or has been reviewed and revised to reflect a safer method of work.8

Furthermore, a SWMS must be reviewed and, if necessary, revised under specific circumstances, including if the work activity changes, if a new hazard is identified, or if an incident occurs during the HRCW.10

### **4.4 Record-Keeping Requirements**

The SWMS must be kept and be readily accessible to any worker involved in the HRCW for the duration of the work.10 It can be kept in electronic format, provided it remains accessible at the workplace.9 If a "notifiable incident" (a serious injury, illness, death, or dangerous incident) occurs in relation to the HRCW, the SWMS must be kept for at least two years from the date of the incident.10 If the SWMS is revised, all versions should be retained for the required period.10

## **Part 5: Strategic Recommendations for Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance**

### **5.1 Developing a Harmonised SWMS Framework for National Operations**

For PCBUs operating nationally, establishing a single, harmonised internal SWMS framework is essential for efficiency and consistent safety standards. This framework should be built upon the most stringent requirements across all jurisdictions. It is recommended to create a "master" SWMS template based on the 18 HRCW activities defined in the model WHS Regulations. This template should include mandatory fields for site-specific adaptation, worker consultation sign-offs, and review triggers.

Crucially, this framework must incorporate a "Victorian Appendix" or a separate, dedicated template for use in Victoria to account for its unique OHS Act, regulations, and HRCW definitions. The system should also clearly flag the different fall-from-height threshold in South Australia (\> 3 metres) versus all other jurisdictions (\> 2 metres) to ensure the SWMS is correctly triggered.

### **5.2 Best Practices for Digital SWMS Management**

Transitioning from paper-based to digital SWMS management offers significant advantages in version control, accessibility, and compliance tracking. A digital system should be selected or developed with the following legal requirements in mind:

* **Accessibility:** The platform must ensure the SWMS is "readily accessible" to workers at the location where the HRCW is performed. This may involve providing tablets on-site or ensuring workers can access it via their personal mobile devices.  
* **Consultation and Sign-off:** The system must have a clear, auditable method for recording worker consultation and sign-off, demonstrating that workers have read, understood, and had the opportunity to contribute to the SWMS.  
* **Version Control:** The platform must manage revisions effectively, ensuring only the current, approved version is in use while securely archiving all previous versions, as required by law.  
* **Review Triggers:** The system should ideally incorporate automated reminders or flags for periodic reviews and allow for easy ad-hoc reviews in response to incidents or changes in work practices.

### **5.3 Ensuring Effective Worker Consultation and Training**

Compliance with the duty to consult is a frequent focus of regulators and a common area of failure for PCBUs. A robust consultation process is non-negotiable. Strategies for ensuring effective consultation include:

* **Pre-start Meetings/Toolbox Talks:** Use these forums not just to brief workers on the SWMS, but to actively solicit feedback on the proposed control measures. Document this feedback and any resulting changes to the SWMS.  
* **Visual Aids:** For complex tasks or for workers with low literacy or from non-English speaking backgrounds, supplement the written SWMS with diagrams, photos, or videos that clearly illustrate the hazards and control measures.  
* **Empowerment to Stop Work:** Training must unequivocally empower every worker to stop work if they believe it is not being conducted in accordance with the SWMS or if they identify a new, uncontrolled hazard. This reinforces the SWMS as a dynamic, living document and demonstrates a genuine commitment to safety culture.
